🧭 Quick Start — Prepare Your USB

Back up files on the USB drive. The process will erase data.
Insert the USB drive into your PC.
Open BadStick.
Choose the target USB drive from the list inside the app.
Pick the exploit type. If you do not know, choose the suggested default or "Auto-detect".
Select the payload file. If you do not have a payload, BadStick includes a default option or points to recommended payloads.
Click "Prepare USB" or "Write". Wait until the app reports success.
Remove the USB safely from your PC.
Now the USB is ready for the console.

🔌 How to Use on Your Xbox 360

Power on the console and navigate to the section that triggers the exploit (this varies by exploit type; the app shows the target).
Follow on-screen prompts on the console to run the exploit.
If the exploit runs, you may see a short console response or app action. The console will proceed according to the exploit flow.
Do not unplug the USB while the console is processing files.
